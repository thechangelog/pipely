# Pipely™ - single-purpose, single-tenant CDN

Based on [Varnish Cache](https://varnish-cache.org/releases/index.html). This started as the simplest CDN running on [fly.io](https://fly.io/changelog)
for [changelog.com](https://changelog.com)

You are welcome to fork this and build your own - OSS FTW 💚

## Post `v1.0`

- Refactor VCL to use `include`
  - This will enable us to do reuse the same configs in the tests [💪 @mttjohnson](https://github.com/thechangelog/pipely/pull/19#pullrequestreview-3013467499)
- [Add logging acceptance tests](https://github.com/thechangelog/pipely/pull/27#issuecomment-3094684063)
- Keep Dagger version in `.github/workflows/_namespace.yaml` in sync with `just/dagger.just`

## Local development and testing

While it's fun watching other people experiment with digital resin (varnish 😂), it's a whole lot more fun when you can repeat those experiments yourself, understand more how it works, and make your own modifications.

### Prerequisites

- 🐳 [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)
- 🤖 [Just](https://github.com/casey/just?tab=readme-ov-file#installation) version `1.27.0` or higher

And that's about it. Everything else is containerized with Dagger.

> [!NOTE]
>  **For Windows Developers:**
> The project's toolchain is made for Linux-like systems. On a Windows machine you will need to have the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) installed in addition to Docker. `just` should be installed inside your WSL Linux operating system. You might be able to run Just natively from Windows, but there are some known bugs related to home directory filenames, so better to avoid that altogether and work directly in WSL.
