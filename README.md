# Pipely™️ - single-purpose, single-tenant CDN

Based on [Varnish Cache](https://varnish-cache.org/releases/index.html) (OSS FTW 💚). This started as the simplest CDN running on [fly.io](https://fly.io/changelog)
for [changelog.com](https://changelog.com)

You are welcome to fork and build this your own.

- ✅ Add redirects from [Fastly VCL](./varnish/changelog.com.vcl) - [PR #19](https://github.com/thechangelog/pipely/pull/19)
- ☑️ All contributors review & clean-up
  - Is the VCL as clean & efficient as it could be?
  - Does everything work as expected?
  - Anything that can be removed?
  - How do we make this friendlier to new users?
  - What would make this more contribution-friendly?
  - How easy is this to use as your own deployment?
  - [Add debug welcome message and prompt #25](https://github.com/thechangelog/pipely/pull/25)
  - [Update documentation and do some local dev tests #22](https://github.com/thechangelog/pipely/pull/22)
- ☑️ Tag & ship `v1.0-rc.1`
- ☑️ Route 10% of production traffic through `v1.0-rc.1`
- ☑️ Tag & ship `v1.0-rc.2` (component updates, etc.)
- ☑️ Route 33% of production traffic through `v1.0-rc.2` (observe cold cache behaviour, etc.)
- ☑️ Tag & ship `v1.0-rc.3` (component updates, etc.)
- ☑️ Route 80% of production traffic through `v1.0-rc.3` (last chance to kick the tyres before `1.0`)
- ☑️ Tag & ship `v1.0`
- ☑️ Route 100% of production traffic through `v1.0`

## What next?

- Refactor VCL to use `include`
  - This will enable us to do reuse the same configs in the tests [💪 @mttjohnson](https://cdn2.changelog.com/uploads/podcast/news-2023-04-03/the-changelog-news-2023-04-03.mp3)

## Local development and testing

### Prerequisites

- Docker or equivalent
- Just version 1.27.0 or higher

And that's about it. Everything else is containerized with Dagger.

**For Windows Developers:**

The project's toolchain is made for Linux-like systems. On a Windows machine you will need to have the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) installed in addition to Docker. `Just` should be installed inside your WSL Linux operating system. You might be able to run Just natively from Windows, but there are some known bugs related to home directory filenames, so better to avoid that altogether and work directly in WSL.

While it's fun watching other people experiment with digital resin (varnish
😂), it's a whole lot more fun when you can repeat those experiments yourself,
understand more how it works, and make your own modifications.

Use 🤖 [`just`](https://github.com/casey/just?tab=readme-ov-file#installation) `v1.27.0` or newer as the starting point:

```bash
just

The only other pre-requisite for the commands that run services locally is 🐳 [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)

## How can you help
